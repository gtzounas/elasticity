# elasticity
- Matlab script producing the graphs of 2 lattices: The first lattice consists of 6 nodes and 12 edges,while the midpoints of the 12 edges are the coordinates of the nodes of the second lattice. 

- The application of an external force deforms the geometry of the examined structure.

- Used to produce the numerical examples of the article I. Dassios, G. Tzounas, F. Milano, A. Jivkov, "A Discrete Model on Force-Based Elasticity and Plasticity", currently under review
  at the Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Elsevier.
